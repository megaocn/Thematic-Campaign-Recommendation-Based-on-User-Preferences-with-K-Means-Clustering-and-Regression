# Thematic Campaign Recommendation Based on User Preferences with K-Means Clustering and Regression

## Project Overview
The project has been done for Python Individual Assignment by RevoU. Inspired by datasets provided by RevoU (thelook e-commerce), I did the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in SQL to understand the revenue and profit growth of each product category and understand the customer retention through cohort analysis, as well as using CTE and Window functions in SQL. 

## Project Summary
Based on the business problem about potential crisis in 2023, the management tends to deprioritized some categories faced the lowest revenue and profit growth. From the data exploration and through the BCG Matrix, I found that socks need to be deprioritized due to low market growth (9.85%) and market share (1%). It also needs collaboration with other teams to increase customer retention rate (only 3% - 11% in 2022) where our retention rate is highly decreased in the first month (1) after first purchase month (0).
