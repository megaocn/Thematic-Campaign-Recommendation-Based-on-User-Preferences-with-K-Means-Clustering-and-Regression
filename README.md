# Thematic Campaign Recommendation Based on User Preferences with K-Means Clustering and Regression

## Project Overview
The project has been done for Python Individual Assignment by RevoU. I was assigned to be a Data Analyst to do data cleaning, descriptive statistics, trend analysis, cluster analysis with K-Means clustering, and churn analysis with regression. All of the tasks have been done by using python, as well as the data visualization by using matplotlib and seaborn. The project focused to analyze the data of Indonesian investment start up company that the users can buy and sell mutual funds.

## Project Summary
Based on the business problem, the Marketing Team need thematic campaign for next month based on user preferences. For budget efficiency, customer segmentation is needed to run targeted campaign. From the data exploration, I found that there are 4 clusters of customers with the highest transaction happened in bond funds and the lowest transaction is mixed funds. Based on benefit cost analysis, we can gain up to Rp11M expected return based on customer segmentation.
